# TasbihZikr

TasbihZikr is a free and very easy to use application, built with the aim to serve as a tool for the act of Tashib. Tasbih is not an item, its an act of zikr. It is actually a Misbaha that is used to perform Tasbih. A Misbaha or 'Tasbih' is also used to keep count of various dua that are recursively recited.

I have used other Tasbih applications myself and i created this with some additions which i thought necessary for a Tasbih application like alerting the zakerin when they finished X no.of repetitions, and with auto resume! If you want any other features added let me know!
